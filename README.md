# CNIT 60
##Presentations transcribed in reveal.js

The following is a transcription of all the Power Point presentations (.pptx) for [Sam Bowne's CNIT 120 class](https://samsclass.info/120/120_S16.shtml) to individual web pages using Reveal.js

## Objective
The purpose of this is to allow for any professor or student to have access to an alternative format to update, customize, amend or subtract from easily without Microsoft Power Point- especially among those that don't have access to a copy of Microsoft Power Point or would prefer using a web-based alternative.

## How To Acquire
There are two ways to obtain this collection of presentations:

* You can get Github Desktop For [Windows](https://desktop.github.com) or [Mac](https://desktop.github.com/#) and git clone to your designated Github folder.
* You can use [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and use the commandline or gui to git clone the entire repository locally
* If you don't have a machine with git installed (or are not familiar with git), you can download zip (you can use Windows .zip extractor or third party tool like 7zip to extract archive).

### After acquisition
* Each presentation is divided by directory according to chapter.
    - In each chapter directory, there's a single "**index.html**" that you can open with any browser supporting Javascript (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, Opera).
    - Enjoy!
